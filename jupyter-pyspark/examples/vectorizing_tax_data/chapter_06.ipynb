    "\n",
    "Purpose:\n",
    "  1. Connect to the vector database and collection initialized in Notebook 05.\n",
    "  2. Identify a specific taxpayer profile in the synthetic data known to exhibit\n",
    "     suspicious cross-source patterns (e.g., low declared income combined with\n",
    "     high-value property ownership, based on Notebook 00 generation logic).\n",
    "  3. Retrieve the vector embedding for this chosen 'query' profile from the DB.\n",
    "  4. Perform a similarity search (query) against the vector database using the\n",
    "     query vector to find the N most similar taxpayer profiles based on their\n",
    "     overall characteristics captured in the embeddings.\n",
    "  5. Extract and display the Taxpayer IDs and similarity scores/distances of the\n",
    "     top results.\n",
    "  6. Save the query results for detailed analysis in the next notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Demonstrating Value:\n",
    "  This notebook showcases the core functionality: leveraging the unified profile\n",
    "  embeddings and vector search to proactively identify entities that resemble a\n",
    "  known 'bad' or suspicious pattern, even when that pattern requires combining\n",
    "  information from multiple original sources.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prerequisites:\n",
    "  - Successful completion of Notebooks 00-05.\n",
    "  - Vector database populated with embeddings and IDs (via Notebook 05).\n",
    "  - Existence of the original synthetic data files (needed to identify the query profile based on N00 logic).\n",
    "  - Vector Database client library installed (e.g., `pip install chromadb`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Outputs:\n",
    "  - The Taxpayer ID of the selected query profile.\n",
    "  - A list of Taxpayer IDs for the N most similar profiles found.\n",
    "  - Corresponding similarity scores/distances.\n",
    "  - These results saved to a file (e.g., 'query_results.json').\n",
    "\n",
    "Next Step:\n",
    "  Notebook 07 will analyze the original source data for these identified similar\n",
    "  profiles to see if they consistently exhibit the suspicious cross-source pattern.\n",
